# HackCamp React - Introduction

### Welcome to the Hackages React challenge!
We have put together a small challenge for you to put your React knowledge to test! 

Below you can find small subtasks for you to complete. Have fun!

### Getting started

First off, you will need to fork the project, then: 
```bash
yarn (or npm install)
yarn start (or npm run start)

# Happy hacking ;)
```


### Tasks

#### 1.
The header is rendered directly in the app.js. Try to extract it and create a Header component to then use this component instead of the header


-> Check the TODO 1 in the code


#### 2.
The selectTab function is the one called when a user clicks on a filter. For now it doesn't work, so your task is to change the selected property of the right filter in the array


-> Check the TODO 2 in the code


#### 3.
Pass the selectTab function to the FilterList component


-> Check the TODO 3 in the code


#### 4.
When the user clicks on the top left icon, the sidebar should be shown.


-> Check the TODO 4 in the code


#### 5.
When the user types something in the search bar (located in the sidebar), you need to update the state and call the filterMovie function.


-> Check the TODO 5 in the code

### Solution
The solution is deployed live [here](https://stupefied-joliot-46811a.netlify.com/)


You can take a look at the solution to see how the app should behave when everything is correct.
